# Feature:Sounds  Music Homepage Navigation and Validation
# As a user
# I WANT to navigate to the Sounds Music Homepage
# SO THAT I can explore music content such as live performances, podcasts, and music categories in one
# location.


# Scenario: Validate the "Mixes" rail and its links
# Then I should see a rail  titled "Mixes" rail 
# And the rail should display five music cards
# When I click on "View All" 
# Then I am taken to the "Mixes" page


# Scenario: Validate the "Tracklist" navigation and content
# Then I should see a rail  titled "Music" rail 
# When I click on a the "Pace Setter" music card
# Then I am taken to the "Pace Setter" page
# And a "Tracklist" section is displayed


# Scenario: Scrollable "Tracklist" of the selected show
#     Then I should see a "Tracklist" displayed in a horizontal grid
#     When I scroll the "Tracklist" to the right
#     Then more "Tracklist" items items appear
